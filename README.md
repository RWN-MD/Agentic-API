# Agentic API

## Introduction
The `Agentic API` repository is a vital component of the [Agentic Network](https://github.com/RWN-MD/Agentic-Network.git) project, providing the interface for developers to interact with `.agent` domains. This repository focuses on enabling seamless communication between agents, managing domain data, and providing developer-friendly tools for building applications within the `.agent` ecosystem.

## Role in the Agentic Network
The `Agentic API` acts as the primary gateway for agent-to-agent communication within the `.agent` namespace. It integrates with other components like the `.agent Registry` and `Agentic DNS` to facilitate secure, efficient, and scalable interactions for registered agents.

## Features
1. **Domain Management Endpoints**
   - APIs for querying, registering, and managing `.agent` domains.

2. **Agent Communication**
   - Provides standardized interfaces for agents to exchange data and commands securely.

3. **Developer Tools**
   - Offers SDKs and example integrations to help developers build agent-based applications.

4. **Security Integration**
   - Works in conjunction with the `Agentic Security` module to authenticate agents and encrypt communication.
